"""Double Diamond cycle implementation for Phase 2 Execution.

The Double Diamond is a design thinking pattern with four phases:
1. Discover (Diverge): Explore problem space, gather insights
2. Define (Converge): Converge on approach, filter through ontology
3. Design (Diverge): Create solution options
4. Deliver (Converge): Implement and validate, filter through ontology

This module implements:
- Phase enum with phase metadata (divergent/convergent, ordering)
- PhaseContext for passing state between phases
- PhaseResult for capturing phase outputs
- DoubleDiamond class orchestrating the full cycle
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for phase failures
- Event emission for phase transitions and cycle lifecycle

Usage:
    from mobius.execution.double_diamond import DoubleDiamond

    dd = DoubleDiamond(llm_adapter=adapter)
    result = await dd.run_cycle(
        execution_id="exec-123",
        seed_id="seed-456",
        current_ac="Implement user authentication",
        iteration=1,
    )
    if result.is_ok:
        cycle_result = result.value
        print(f"Cycle completed: {cycle_result.success}")
