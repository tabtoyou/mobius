"""Event factories for the evaluation pipeline.

This module provides factory functions for creating evaluation-related events.
All events follow the dot.notation.past_tense naming convention.

Event Types:
    evaluation.stage1.started - Mechanical verification started
    evaluation.stage1.completed - Mechanical verification completed
    evaluation.stage2.started - Semantic evaluation started
    evaluation.stage2.completed - Semantic evaluation completed
    evaluation.stage3.started - Consensus evaluation started
    evaluation.stage3.completed - Consensus evaluation completed
    evaluation.consensus.triggered - Consensus trigger activated
    evaluation.pipeline.completed - Full pipeline completed
