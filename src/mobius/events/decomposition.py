"""Event definitions for AC decomposition and atomicity detection.

These events enable full traceability of AC lifecycle through event sourcing:
- Atomicity checks and their results
- AC decomposition into children
- AC marking as atomic (ready for execution)

Event naming follows dot.notation.past_tense convention.
