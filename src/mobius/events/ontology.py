"""Ontological Analysis Events.

Events emitted during ontological analysis across phases.
These events support observability and audit trails for
the AOP-based ontological framework.

Event Types:
- ontology.analysis.passed: Analysis passed, execution continues
- ontology.analysis.violated: Analysis failed, execution may halt
