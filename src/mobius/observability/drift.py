"""Drift measurement engine for Mobius.

This module implements Story 6.1: Drift Measurement Engine.

Drift measures how far the current execution state has deviated from
the original Seed specification. Three components are tracked:
1. Goal drift: Deviation from the stated objective
2. Constraint drift: Constraint violations accumulated
3. Ontology drift: Evolution of the concept space

The combined drift uses weighted formula (PM 13.1):
    combined = (goal * 0.5) + (constraint * 0.3) + (ontology * 0.2)

NFR5 requires combined drift ≤ 0.3 to be acceptable.

Usage:
    from mobius.observability.drift import (
        DriftMeasurement,
        DriftMetrics,
        DriftMeasuredEvent,
    )

    measurement = DriftMeasurement()
    metrics = measurement.measure(
        current_output="CLI task manager",
        constraint_violations=[],
        current_concepts=["tasks", "status"],
        seed=seed,
    )

    if not metrics.is_acceptable:
        # Combined drift > 0.3 - may need consensus
        event = DriftThresholdExceededEvent(...)
