"""Plugin orchestration module for task scheduling and routing.

This package provides:
- Router: Smart model tier selection (PAL routing)
- Scheduler: Parallel task execution with dependency resolution
- Hooks: Event system for agent coordination

Architecture:
- Router extends routing.complexity for complexity estimation
- Scheduler uses asyncio for parallel execution
- Hooks integrate with events.base
