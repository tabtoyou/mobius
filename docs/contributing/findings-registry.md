  LEGACY ARCHIVE (schema v1.5, frozen 2026-03-15): This findings registry is
  frozen. A multi-entity registry migration was planned but successor files have
  not yet been created. Do NOT add new findings here; track issues via GitHub
  Issues instead. This file is preserved for historical reference.
  Original description: Canonical, deduplicated registry of every documentation
  finding produced by all previous-generation static audits. Each entry carries
  a normalized id, a concise claim statement, severity, gap_type (and optional
  sub_qualifier), resolution status, the set of affected documents, and a pointer
  to the fix or recommendation.
schema_changelog:
  "1.5": >-
    2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 3 of AC 1): FREEZE. This file is now a legacy-frozen
    archive. A multi-entity registry migration (FIND-NNN → FND-NNN) was planned
    but successor files were not created. Schema bumped 1.4→1.5; no entries
    modified (backward-compatible).
  "1.4": >-
    2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 2-1): Added claim_id (format: CLM-NNN, pattern ^CLM-[0-9]{3,}$)
    as a required field on every finding entry, making claims independently referenceable
    entities separate from their FIND-NNN finding identifier. Added code_deps[] (required;
    empty list [] for doc-only or cross-doc findings) to each entry, linking each claim to
    the source code files that establish its truth value. Schema bumped 1.3→1.4;
    all 50 FIND-NNN entries migrated. No existing fields removed or renamed (backward-compatible).
  "1.3": >-
    2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 6c): Added inaccuracy gap_type with sub_qualifier support;
    deprecated contradiction as alias for inaccuracy+sub_qualifier:cross-doc;
    migrated FIND-014, FIND-022, FIND-040 from gap_type:contradiction to
    gap_type:inaccuracy + sub_qualifier:cross-doc; field renamed gap_type_qualifier
    → sub_qualifier for consistency with claim-registry-spec.yaml;
    no dangling references to removed inconsistency enum value remain.
  "1.2": >-
    2026-03-15 (AC-06): gap_type enum refactor announced; gap_type_qualifier
    (now sub_qualifier) introduced in description; severity_audit applied.

# Documentation Findings Registry

> **Purpose:** Single authoritative record of all documentation audit findings.
> All findings from the per-topic audit reports have been merged here, duplicates
> eliminated, and each entry assigned a normalized `FIND-NNN` identifier.
>
> **Schema version:** 1.5 | **Last updated:** 2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 3 of AC 1: multi-entity migration; schema 1.4→1.5)
>
> **⚠️ LEGACY ARCHIVE:** This file is frozen as of 2026-03-15.
> A multi-entity registry migration was planned but the successor files have not yet been created.
> Do NOT add new findings here. Track issues via GitHub Issues instead.
>
> **Note:** All entries in this file implicitly carry `record_type: finding`.
> FIND-NNN IDs were intended to map 1:1 to FND-NNN in a planned entity registry
> (not yet created).
>
> **Source audits merged:** CLI command audit · Config doc audit ·
> Cross-document contradiction scan · Skill-CLI mapping audit ·
> Semantic link-rot report · Runtime capability crosscheck

## Schema Reference

> **v1.5 NOTE:** A multi-entity registry migration was planned (FIND-NNN → FND-NNN).
> The successor files have not yet been created. This schema reference remains for
> historical context only.

Each finding record carries these **ten** fields (v1.5 adds `record_type`):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `record_type` | `finding` | *(v1.5, implicit for all entries in this file)* Multi-entity discriminator. All FIND-NNN entries in this legacy file are implicitly `record_type: finding`. |
| `id` | `FIND-NNN` | Normalized, stable finding identifier |
| `claim_id` | `CLM-NNN` | *(v1.4, required)* Stable claim identifier — independently referenceable entity separate from the finding ID. Format: `CLM-NNN` (three or more digits, zero-padded). Allows claim cross-referencing without coupling to the finding sequence. |
| `claim` | string | Concise statement of the erroneous or missing claim |
| `severity` | `critical` \| `high` \| `medium` \| `low` | Impact per [CONTRIBUTING.md rubric](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-issue-severity-rubric) |
| `gap_type` | enum (see below) | Nature of the documentation gap |
| `sub_qualifier` | string \| null | *(v1.3, optional — renamed from `gap_type_qualifier`)* Narrows `gap_type: inaccuracy`; see qualifier table below |
| `status` | `resolved` \| `open` \| `tracked` | Current resolution state |
| `affected_documents` | list of paths | Documents that contain or must receive the fix |
| `code_deps` | list of paths | *(v1.4, required)* Source code files that establish the claim's truth value. Empty list `[]` for purely cross-doc or documentation-only findings. Paths relative to repository root. |
| `resolution_ref` | string | Source-audit ID(s) and/or fix description |

### `gap_type` Values

> **v1.3 ENUM CONTRACT (Sub-AC 6c, 2026-03-15)**
> - `inconsistency` is **NOT** a valid `gap_type` value and never was.  Use
>   `gap_type: inaccuracy` + `sub_qualifier: cross-doc` to express cross-document
>   inconsistencies.  All downstream consumers have been audited: zero dangling
>   references to `inconsistency` exist in any registry entry.
> - `contradiction` is **DEPRECATED** and **fully migrated** as of schema v1.3.
>   All FIND-NNN entries that previously carried `gap_type: contradiction` have been
>   updated to `gap_type: inaccuracy` + `sub_qualifier: cross-doc` (see FIND-014,
>   FIND-022, FIND-040).  New findings MUST NOT use `contradiction`; use
>   `gap_type: inaccuracy` + `sub_qualifier: cross-doc` instead.
> - `gap_type_qualifier` (v1.2 field name) is renamed to `sub_qualifier` in v1.3.
>   The old field name is accepted as a backward-compatible alias by any tool that
>   reads this registry, but all new entries MUST use `sub_qualifier`.

| Value | Meaning | Qualifier applicable? |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `wrong-value` | Doc states a factually incorrect value (wrong path, flag name, key, count) | No |
| `missing-content` | Content that exists in code/runtime but is absent from docs | No |
| `misleading` | Correct information absent or framing creates false expectations | No |
| `inaccuracy` | Doc makes a factual claim that is incorrect or inconsistent with the source of truth; use `sub_qualifier` to sub-classify (e.g., `cross-doc` for cross-document conflicts) | **Yes** (required when qualifier applies) |
| `staleness` | Once-correct content that no longer matches current implementation; only set when a staleness signal has fired (a file in `code_deps[]` modified since `last_verified`) and the claim has not been re-verified. Set by SEC-010 in `staleness-enforcement-spec.yaml`. **Replaces former `stale` value (renamed v1.7).** | No |
| `stale` | *(DEPRECATED — renamed to `staleness` in schema v1.7, Sub-AC 3c)* Legacy alias; migrate all existing entries to `staleness`. | *(legacy)* |
| `link-rot` | A link exists but its target cannot fulfill what the source context promises | No |
| `contradiction` | *(DEPRECATED — use `inaccuracy + qualifier: cross-doc`)* Two documents state mutually exclusive values for the same claim | *(legacy)* |

### `sub_qualifier` Values

Applies only when `gap_type: inaccuracy`.  Absent or `null` when `gap_type` is any
other value.  *(Field was named `gap_type_qualifier` in schema v1.2; renamed to
`sub_qualifier` in v1.3 for alignment with claim-registry-spec.yaml conventions.)*

| Qualifier | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `cross-doc` | The inaccuracy is a cross-document inconsistency: two or more docs make mutually exclusive claims about the same fact.  One (or more) of them is wrong relative to the source of truth.  **This qualifier replaces the deprecated `contradiction` gap_type.** Previously informal descriptions of these findings as "inconsistencies" must use this canonical form. |
| `stale-value` | The inaccuracy arises from a value that was once correct but diverged after a code change.  Use `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: stale-value` when the claim is directly contradicted by current source code (not merely likely outdated). NOTE (v1.7 Sub-AC 3a): In the **claim registry** (claim-registry.yaml), staleness is now expressed via `staleness_signal.cause: code_dep_changed` (not via `gap_type`). In the **findings registry** (this file), `gap_type: staleness` remains valid for findings about once-correct-now-drifted values. Use `staleness` (not `inaccuracy`) when the claim may still be correct but has not been re-verified after a code change. |
| `aspirational` | The inaccuracy is a forward-looking or placeholder claim presented as current fact.  Use this sub_qualifier instead of leaving the claim unclassified when the mismatch is intentional-but-misleading (e.g., docs describe a planned feature as if already shipped). |

### `severity` Definitions (per CONTRIBUTING.md)

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| `critical` | User follows docs and **fails** (command error, wrong path, flag rejected) |
| `high` | User proceeds **incorrectly** or holds a false expectation. Includes: nonexistent env vars that silently have no effect; major config sections absent from all docs (user cannot configure production behavior). |
| `medium` | User is mildly confused but can still succeed. Includes: option missing from one reference doc but present in another; minor behavior notes absent; optional/minor config sections undocumented. |
| `low` | Minor gap; cosmetic; an alternative form is undocumented but the canonical form works; edge case covered elsewhere. No confusion or incorrect outcome results. |

> **Rubric alignment note (AC-06, 2026-03-15):** The `low` level was not in CONTRIBUTING.md's
> original rubric (which defined only Critical/High/Medium). The rubric has been updated to include
> `low` as a formal fourth level. Findings previously classified as `low` have been re-evaluated:
> nonexistent env vars upgraded to `high`; undocumented-but-harmless gaps upgraded to `medium`;
> the `low` bucket is now empty across all 50 registry entries.

## Status Summary

| Severity | Total | Resolved | Open |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| critical | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| high | 26 | 24 | 2 |
| medium | 20 | 20 | 0 |
| low | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **50** | **48** | **2** |

> **Note (AC-06 severity audit, 2026-03-15):** 11 findings reclassified upward and 4 reclassified
> from `low` to `medium` to align with the CONTRIBUTING.md severity rubric. `low` is now 0 — all
> findings at or above `medium`. The `medium open` count corrects a pre-existing table error (was
> stated as 1; actual count was 2 before FIND-050 moved from `low` to `medium`).

Open findings: [FIND-018](#find-018) *(high)*, [FIND-019](#find-019) *(high)*

      skill does: the skill first checks current version against PyPI,
      prompts for confirmation, then upgrades, with an optional Claude Code
      plugin update step.

## Open Findings Detail

### FIND-018 — `README.md` → `claude-code.md` workflow mismatch (high)

The README Quick Start for Claude Code presents `claude plugin marketplace add` +
`mob skill` commands as the primary workflow and links to `docs/runtime-guides/claude-code.md`
for "full details." The linked document covers a completely different install path
(`pip install mobius-ai[claude]`) and different commands
(`uv run mobius run workflow --orchestrator`). A user following the README Quick Start
will find the "full details" link goes to documentation for an entirely different workflow.

**Recommended fix (one of):**
1. Expand `claude-code.md` to cover the `claude plugin marketplace add` + `mob` workflow as the primary Claude Code path.
2. Update `README.md` Quick Start to use the `pip install` + orchestrator path that `claude-code.md` documents.
3. If `claude plugin marketplace add` is not yet live, mark it `[NOT YET AVAILABLE]` and remove the cross-link promise.

---

### FIND-019 — `architecture.md` → `claude-code.md` workflow mismatch (high)

Same root cause as FIND-018. `docs/architecture.md` Deployment section shows
`claude plugin marketplace add` + `mob interview` as the Claude Code path and links
to `claude-code.md` for "full details." The target documents only the `pip install` +
orchestrator CLI path. Fix is the same as FIND-018.

---

### FIND-044 — `mob status` CLI equivalent wrong in `codex.md` (medium) — RESOLVED

**Fixed in:** `docs/fix-audit-findings` branch. Updated `codex.md:96` to show both
`mobius status executions` (list all) and `mobius status execution <id>` (details),
with note that drift-measurement is MCP-only.

---

### FIND-045 — Runtime guides lack `credentials.yaml` cross-link (medium) — RESOLVED

**Fixed in:** `docs/fix-audit-findings` branch. Added `credentials.yaml` cross-links
to both `claude-code.md` and `codex.md` prerequisites sections.

---

### FIND-050 — `mob update` CLI equivalent understates skill behavior (low) — RESOLVED

**Already fixed:** `codex.md:104` already includes parenthetical clarification:
"(upgrades directly; the skill also checks current vs. latest version before upgrading — the CLI skips that check)".

---

## Deduplication Notes

The following source-audit IDs were merged into single registry entries to eliminate
duplicate tracking:

| Registry Entry | Merged Source IDs |
|----------------|------------------|
| FIND-004 | `CONTRADICTION-001` + `runtime-capability-crosscheck.md#Sec11` |
| FIND-009 | `cli-audit-findings.md#F-06` + `runtime-capability-crosscheck.md#Sec5` |
| FIND-015 | `CONTRADICTION-004` + `config-doc-findings.md#OPEN-003` |
| FIND-016 | `config-doc-findings.md#FINDING-005` + `runtime-capability-crosscheck.md#Sec4` + `runtime-capability-crosscheck.md#4c-2` + `doc-issues-register.md#ISSUE-R06` |

The `doc-issues-register.md` entries ISSUE-R01 through ISSUE-R09 and ISSUE-001 are
cross-references to primary findings already captured above; they are not recorded as
separate entries.

Source audit `cli-audit-findings.md#F-09` (commands/__init__.py internal docstring
missing cancel/setup/tui) was intentionally excluded: it is a source code change, which
is out of scope for documentation-only findings.

---

## Filing a New Finding

Use the template below when adding a new `FIND-NNN` entry to the YAML findings block.
Assign the next sequential ID and choose `gap_type` from the valid enum; add
`sub_qualifier` only when `gap_type: inaccuracy`.

```yaml
- id: FIND-NNN                      # next available sequential ID
  claim: >-
    <one-paragraph factual statement of what is wrong or missing>
  severity: critical | high | medium | low
  gap_type: wrong-value | missing-content | misleading | inaccuracy | staleness | link-rot
  # sub_qualifier: cross-doc | stale-value | aspirational
  #   ^ include ONLY when gap_type: inaccuracy; omit entirely otherwise
  #   ^ cross-doc: inaccuracy is a conflict between two or more docs (replaces deprecated 'contradiction')
  #   ^ stale-value: inaccuracy is a diverged value after a code change
  #   ^ aspirational: inaccuracy is a planned/placeholder claim presented as current fact
  status: open | resolved | tracked
  affected_documents:
    - docs/<path/to/doc.md>
  resolution_ref: "<source-audit-id>; <fix description or 'pending'>"
```

**gap_type selection guide:**
- A doc says `~/.mobius/data/mobius.db` but source says `~/.mobius/mobius.db` → `wrong-value`
- A flag exists in code but no doc mentions it → `missing-content`
- A doc is technically correct but creates false expectations → `misleading`
- Doc A and Doc B say different things about the same fact → `inaccuracy` + `sub_qualifier: cross-doc`
- A link target doesn't match what the source context promises → `link-rot`
- A value was correct six months ago but code changed, and not yet re-verified → `staleness`
- A value that was once correct but is now directly contradicted by code → `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: stale-value`
- **NEVER use** `stale` (renamed to `staleness` in schema v1.7, Sub-AC 3c; see migration note below)
- **NEVER use** `decay` (was never a valid enum value; see v1.7 migration below)
- **NEVER use** `inconsistency` (not a valid enum value; see v1.2/v1.3 migration below)
- **NEVER use** `contradiction` for new entries (deprecated in v1.2, fully retired in v1.3; use `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: cross-doc`)
- **NEVER use** `gap_type_qualifier` in new entries (renamed to `sub_qualifier` in v1.3)

---

## Schema Changelog

### v1.4 — 2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 3c: gap_type 'stale' renamed to 'staleness'; 'decay' banned)

**Changes:**

1. **`stale` renamed to `staleness`.**  The `gap_type: stale` enum value has been renamed
   to `gap_type: staleness` in `claim-registry-spec.yaml` v1.7 (Sub-AC 3c).  The rename
   introduces an explicit trigger condition: `staleness` MUST only be set when a staleness
   signal has fired (a file in `code_deps[]` was modified after `last_verified`) AND the
   claim has not been re-verified.  This operationalises staleness as an executable
   mechanism (SEC-010) rather than a passive annotation.
2. **`decay` explicitly banned.**  `gap_type: decay` was never a valid enum value.
   The `no_decay_gap_type` validation rule (ERROR) in `claim-registry-spec.yaml` v1.7
   formally prohibits both `decay` and the legacy `stale` spelling.
3. **`doc-decay` terminology removed.**  Generated docs (`link-index.md`,
   `section-content-index.md`) that referred to "doc-decay detection" have been updated to
   use "staleness detection".
4. **FIND-043 migrated.**  The single live entry carrying `gap_type: stale` (FIND-043) has
   been updated to `gap_type: staleness`.

**Migration notes for tooling consumers (v1.4 update):**

- Parsers MUST reject `gap_type: decay` (was never valid).
- Parsers MUST reject `gap_type: stale` on entries added AFTER schema_version 1.4
  (rename to `staleness`).  Parsers MAY emit a deprecation WARNING on pre-v1.4 entries.
- Parsers MUST only set `gap_type: staleness` when a staleness signal is active per
  SEC-010 (staleness-enforcement-spec.yaml v1.4).
- The relationship between `staleness` and `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: stale-value`:
  - Use `staleness` when the claim may still be correct but is unverified after a code change.
  - Use `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: stale-value` when the claim is directly contradicted
    by the current code value (the value changed; the doc states the old value).

**[Sub-AC 3a NOTE — v1.7 claim-registry schema]:** In `claim-registry.yaml`, `gap_type:
staleness` has been RETIRED from the claim registry enum (Sub-AC 3a, 2026-03-15).
Staleness in claims is now expressed via `staleness_signal.cause` (enum:
`code_dep_changed | time_elapsed | upstream_changed`).  In THIS findings-registry,
`gap_type: staleness` REMAINS VALID — these are separate schemas.  Parsers consuming
findings-registry data MUST NOT apply the claim-registry no_stale_gap_type rule here.

**Entries migrated in this pass:**

| Finding | Old gap_type | New gap_type | Migration note |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| FIND-043 | `stale` | `staleness` | Renamed per schema v1.7 / Sub-AC 3c |

**Audit result:** One live entry (`FIND-043`) carried `gap_type: stale` — migrated above.
Zero entries carried `gap_type: decay` (was never valid, confirmed absent).

---

### v1.3 — 2026-03-15 (Sub-AC 6c: gap_type migration completed)

**Changes:**

1. **`gap_type_qualifier` renamed to `sub_qualifier`.**  The field was introduced
   as `gap_type_qualifier` in v1.2 but renamed to the shorter `sub_qualifier` in v1.3
   for consistency with `claim-registry-spec.yaml` conventions.
   Tooling MUST accept `gap_type_qualifier` as a backward-compatible alias.
2. **`contradiction` fully retired.**  All three entries that carried `gap_type: contradiction`
   (FIND-014, FIND-022, FIND-040) have been migrated to `gap_type: inaccuracy` +
   `sub_qualifier: cross-doc`.  The `contradiction` value remains in the enum table
   as a marked-deprecated entry for backward compatibility, but no live entry uses it.
3. **`inconsistency` confirmed absent.**  A full audit of all 50 FIND-NNN entries
   confirms zero instances of `gap_type: inconsistency`.  The term was used informally
   in prose narrative (runtime-capability-crosscheck.md) but was never a registry
   field value.  The prohibition is now documented in both the enum table and the
   selection guide.

**Migration notes for tooling consumers (v1.3 update):**

- Parsers MAY reject `gap_type: contradiction` on entries added AFTER schema_version 1.3
  (new entries must use `inaccuracy + sub_qualifier: cross-doc`).
- Parsers MUST accept both `sub_qualifier` and `gap_type_qualifier` as field names
  for the sub-qualifier value (backward-compatible alias support).
- Parsers MUST emit a validation ERROR when `gap_type` is `inconsistency`.
- Parsers MUST emit a validation ERROR when `sub_qualifier` (or `gap_type_qualifier`)
  is present on an entry whose `gap_type` is not `inaccuracy`.
- The canonical field name is `sub_qualifier`; `gap_type_qualifier` is legacy.

**Entries migrated in this pass:**

| Finding | Old gap_type | New gap_type | sub_qualifier |
|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| FIND-014 | `contradiction` | `inaccuracy` | `cross-doc` |
| FIND-022 | `contradiction` | `inaccuracy` | `cross-doc` |
| FIND-040 | `contradiction` | `inaccuracy` | `cross-doc` |

**Audit result:** Zero dangling `gap_type: inconsistency` references found across all
50 FIND-NNN entries, all narrative prose in this registry, all related docs
(runtime-capability-crosscheck.md uses the term in narrative but not as a field value),
and CONTRIBUTING.md severity rubric (uses "inconsistency" to describe style issues,
not as a gap_type enum value).

---

### v1.2 — 2026-03-15 (gap_type enum refactor)

**Changes:**

1. **Added `gap_type_qualifier` field** (optional; applies only to `gap_type: inaccuracy`).
   Carries sub-classification values: `cross-doc`, `stale-value`, `aspirational`.
2. **Added `inaccuracy` to `gap_type` enum.**  This is the preferred value when a doc
   makes a factual claim that is wrong or inconsistent with the source of truth.
3. **Deprecated `contradiction`.**  Existing entries using `gap_type: contradiction`
   remained valid (backward-compatible) pending the v1.3 data migration.
4. **Explicitly excluded `inconsistency`.**  `inconsistency` was never a valid
   enum value but appeared in informal usage.  Formally documented as invalid.

**Note:** The v1.2 deprecation of `contradiction` was completed by the v1.3 data
migration (Sub-AC 6c).  The three remaining `contradiction` entries that were deferred
in v1.2 have now been migrated.

### v1.1 — 2026-03-15 (severity audit)

Severity labels normalized; LOW level formally defined; 15 findings reclassified.
See frontmatter `severity_audit` field for details.

### v1.0 — 2026-03-15 (initial registry)

Canonical, deduplicated registry created from five per-topic audit report files.
