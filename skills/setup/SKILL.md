# /mobius:setup

Guided onboarding wizard that converts users into power users.

> **Standalone users** (Codex, pip install): Use `mobius setup --runtime codex` in your terminal instead.
> This skill runs inside a Claude Code session. For other runtime backends, the CLI `mobius setup` command handles configuration.
> For full install and onboarding instructions, see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Usage

```
mob setup
/mobius:setup
/mobius:setup --uninstall
```

> **Note**: Setup does two things:
> 1. **MCP server registration** (`~/.claude/mcp.json`) — one-time, global across all projects
> 2. **CLAUDE.md integration** (optional) — per-project, adds an Mobius command reference block
>
> After the first run, you only need to re-run setup in new projects if you want the CLAUDE.md integration.

## Setup Wizard Flow

When the user invokes this skill, guide them through an enhanced 6-step wizard with progressive disclosure and celebration checkpoints.

---

### Step 0: Welcome & Motivation (The Hook)

Start with energy and clear value:

```
Welcome to Mobius Setup!

Let's unlock your full AI development potential.

What you'll get:
- Visual TUI dashboard for real-time progress tracking
- 3-stage evaluation pipeline for quality assurance
- Drift detection to keep projects on track
- Cost optimization (85% savings on average)

Setup takes ~2 minutes. Let's go!
```

---

### Step 0.5: Community Support

Before we begin, check `~/.mobius/prefs.json` for `star_asked`. If not `true`, use **AskUserQuestion**:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Mobius is free and open-source. A GitHub star helps other developers discover it. Star the repo?",
    "header": "Community",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Star on GitHub",
        "description": "Takes 1 second — helps the project grow"
      },
      {
        "label": "Skip for now",
        "description": "Continue with setup"
      }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

- **Star on GitHub**: Run `gh api -X PUT /user/starred/tabtoyou/mobius`, save `{"star_asked": true}` to `~/.mobius/prefs.json`
- **Skip for now**: Save `{"star_asked": true}` to `~/.mobius/prefs.json`
- **Other**: Save `{"star_asked": true}`

Create `~/.mobius/` directory if it doesn't exist.

If `star_asked` is already `true`, skip this step silently.

---

### Step 1: Environment Detection

Check the user's environment with clear feedback:

```bash
python3 --version
which uvx 2>/dev/null && uvx --version 2>/dev/null
which claude 2>/dev/null
```

**IMPORTANT: If system Python is < 3.12 but uvx is available, also check uv-managed Python:**

```bash
uv python list 2>/dev/null | grep "cpython-3.1[2-9]"
```

If `uv python list` shows Python >= 3.12 available, this counts as **Full Mode** because `uvx mobius-ai mcp serve` automatically uses uv-managed Python >= 3.12 (not system Python).

**Report results with personality:**

```
Environment Detected:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

System Python 3.11         [!] Below 3.12
uv Python 3.12+            [✓] Available (uvx will use this)
uvx package runner         [✓] Available
Runtime backend            [✓] Detected

→ Full Mode Available (via uvx + uv-managed Python >= 3.12)
```

**Decision Matrix:**

| Environment | Mode | Action |
|:------------|:-----|:-------|
| uvx + Python >= 3.12 | **Ready** | Proceed to MCP registration (uvx mode — extras always included) |
| No uvx + `mobius` binary in PATH | **Check deps** | Verify `[claude]` extras, then proceed (binary mode) |
| No uvx + Python >= 3.12 + `python3 -m mobius` works | **Check deps** | Verify `[claude]` extras, then proceed (pip mode) |
| uvx + Python < 3.12 only | **Install needed** | Run `uv python install 3.12` then proceed |
| No uvx + no mobius binary + no pip package | **Install needed** | Install uv first, then proceed |

**For binary/pip modes — verify `[claude]` extras are installed:**

Check method depends on how mobius was installed:
```bash
# Detect install method
pipx list 2>/dev/null | grep -q mobius && echo "PIPX" || echo "NOT_PIPX"
```

- **pipx users** (binary mode, installed via pipx):
  ```bash
  pipx runpip mobius-ai show claude-agent-sdk 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPS_OK" || echo "DEPS_MISSING"
  ```
  If `DEPS_MISSING`: `pipx install --force mobius-ai[claude]`

- **pip users** (pip mode):
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import claude_agent_sdk" 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPS_OK" || echo "DEPS_MISSING"
  ```
  If `DEPS_MISSING`: `python3 -m pip install mobius-ai[claude]`

If deps are missing and the user doesn't want to fix manually, recommend uvx:
```
Or install uvx (recommended — handles deps automatically):
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Then re-run: mob setup
```

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP server requires one of: (1) uvx, (2) mobius binary in PATH, or (3) mobius pip-installed. For options 2 and 3, the `[claude]` extra must also be installed. If none are available, guide the user to install uv — do NOT write a non-working fallback to mcp.json.

**If prerequisites are missing, show:**
```
Mobius requires uvx (recommended) or the mobius package installed.

Quick install (< 1 minute):
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  uv python install 3.12

Then re-run: mob setup
```

**Celebration Checkpoint 1:**
```
Great news! You're ready for the full Mobius experience.
```

---

### Step 2: MCP Server Registration

Check if `~/.claude/mcp.json` exists:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/mcp.json 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

**Show progress:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Registering MCP Server...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Connecting Mobius Python core to your runtime backend.
This enables:

  Visual TUI Dashboard    [Watch execution in real-time]
  3-Stage Evaluation     [Mechanical → Semantic → Consensus]
  Drift Detection        [Alert when projects go off-track]
  Session Replay         [Debug any execution from events]
```

**Automatically create or update `~/.claude/mcp.json`** (user-level, works across all projects).

Choose the MCP command based on how mobius is installed (check in order):
1. If `which uvx` succeeds: `{"command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "mobius-ai[claude]", "mobius", "mcp", "serve"]}`
2. If `which mobius` succeeds: `{"command": "mobius", "args": ["mcp", "serve"]}`
3. If `python3 -c "import mobius"` succeeds: `{"command": "python3", "args": ["-m", "mobius", "mcp", "serve"]}`
4. If none of the above → **do NOT write to mcp.json**. Instead show the prerequisites message from Step 1 and stop.

If `~/.claude/mcp.json` already exists, read it, **always overwrite the `mobius` key** with the entry above (to fix stale args from older versions), and preserve all other server entries.

**Celebration Checkpoint 2:**
```
MCP Server Registered! You can now:
- Run mob run for visual TUI execution
- Run mob evaluate for 3-stage verification
- Run mob status for drift tracking
```

---

### Step 3: CLAUDE.md Integration (Optional)

Ask with clear value proposition:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  CLAUDE.md Integration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Add Mobius quick-reference to your CLAUDE.md?

This gives you instant command reminders without leaving
your project context.

What gets added (~40 lines):
- Philosophy and pipeline overview
- Command routing table with lazy-loaded agents
- Agent catalog summary

A backup will be created: CLAUDE.md.bak

[Integrate / Skip / Preview first]
```

**If "Preview first", show:**
````markdown
<!-- mob:START -->
<!-- mob:VERSION:0.26.3 -->
# Mobius — Specification-First AI Development

> Before telling AI what to build, define what should be built.
> As Socrates asked 2,500 years ago — "What do you truly know?"
> Mobius turns that question into an evolutionary AI workflow engine.

Most AI coding fails at the input, not the output. Mobius fixes this by
**exposing hidden assumptions before any code is written**.

1. **Socratic Clarity** — Question until ambiguity ≤ 0.2
2. **Ontological Precision** — Solve the root problem, not symptoms
3. **Evolutionary Loops** — Each evaluation cycle feeds back into better specs

```
Interview → Seed → Execute → Evaluate
    ↑                           ↓
    └─── Evolutionary Loop ─────┘
```

## mob Commands

Each command loads its agent/MCP on-demand. Details in each skill file.

| Command | Loads |
|---------|-------|
| `mob` | — |
| `mob interview` | `mobius:socratic-interviewer` |
| `mob seed` | `mobius:seed-architect` |
| `mob run` | MCP required |
| `mob evolve` | MCP: `evolve_step` |
| `mob evaluate` | `mobius:evaluator` |
| `mob unstuck` | `mobius:{persona}` |
| `mob status` | MCP: `session_status` |
| `mob setup` | — |
| `mob help` | — |

## Agents

Loaded on-demand — not preloaded.

**Core**: socratic-interviewer, ontologist, seed-architect, evaluator,
wonder, reflect, advocate, contrarian, judge
**Support**: hacker, simplifier, researcher, architect
<!-- mob:END -->
````

**If Integrate:**
1. Backup existing CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE.md.bak
2. Append the block above
3. Confirm successful integration

**Celebration Checkpoint 3:**
```
CLAUDE.md updated! You now have instant Mobius reference
available in every project.
```

### Step 4: Quick Verification

Run verification with visual feedback:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Verifying Setup...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Check skills are loadable:
```bash
ls skills/ | wc -l  # Should show 12+ skills
```

Check agents are available:
```bash
ls src/mobius/agents/*.md | wc -l  # Should show 20+ bundled agents
```

Check MCP registration (if enabled):
```bash
cat ~/.claude/mcp.json | grep -q mobius && echo "MCP: ✓" || echo "MCP: ✗"
```

### Step 5.5: Brownfield Repository Scan

Scan the user's home directory for existing git repositories and register them in the Mobius DB. This enables interviews to use brownfield context for existing projects.

**Show scanning indicator:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Scanning for Existing Projects...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Looking for git repositories in your home directory.
Only GitHub-hosted repos will be registered.
This may take a moment...
```

**Implementation — use MCP tools only, do NOT use CLI or Python scripts:**

1. Load the brownfield MCP tool: `ToolSearch query: "+mobius brownfield"`
2. Call scan+register:
   ```
   Tool: mobius_brownfield
   Arguments: { "action": "scan" }
   ```
   This scans `~/` for GitHub repos and registers them in DB. Existing defaults are preserved.

The scan response `text` already contains a pre-formatted numbered list with `[default]` markers. **Do NOT make any additional MCP calls to list or query repos.**

**Display the repos in a plain-text 2-column grid** (NOT a markdown table). Use a code block so columns align. Example:

```
Scan complete. 8 repositories registered.

 1. repo-alpha                   5. repo-epsilon
 2. repo-bravo *                 6. repo-foxtrot
 3. repo-charlie                 7. repo-golf *
 4. repo-delta                   8. repo-hotel
```

Include `*` markers for defaults exactly as they appear in the scan response. Do not summarize or truncate the list. The user needs to see all repo numbers to pick defaults.

**If no repos found**, skip the default selection prompt and proceed to Step 6.

**Default repo selection — IMMEDIATELY after showing the list:**

Use `AskUserQuestion` with the current default numbers from the scan response.

**If defaults exist**, show them as the recommended option:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which repos to set as default for interviews? Enter numbers like '6, 18, 19'.",
    "header": "Default Repos",
    "options": [
      {"label": "<current default numbers> (Recommended)", "description": "<current default names>"},
      {"label": "None", "description": "Clear all defaults — interviews will run in greenfield mode"},
      {"label": "Select repos", "description": "Type repo numbers to set as default"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**If no defaults exist**, do NOT show a "(Recommended)" option — offer "None" and "Select repos" instead:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Which repos to set as default for interviews? Enter numbers like '6, 18, 19'.",
    "header": "Default Repos",
    "options": [
      {"label": "None", "description": "No default repos — interviews will run in greenfield mode"},
      {"label": "Select repos", "description": "Type repo numbers to set as default"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

The user can select the recommended defaults (if any), choose "None", or type custom numbers.

After the user responds, use ONE MCP call to update all defaults at once:

```
Tool: mobius_brownfield
Arguments: { "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "<comma-separated IDs>" }
```

Example: if the user picks IDs 6, 18, 19 → `{ "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "6,18,19" }`

This clears all existing defaults and sets the selected repos as default in one call.

If "none" → `{ "action": "set_defaults", "indices": "" }` to clear all defaults.

**Celebration Checkpoint 5.5:**
```
Brownfield defaults updated!
Defaults: podo-app, podo-backend, grape

These repos will be used as context in interviews.
```

Or if "none" selected:
```
No default repos set. interviews will run in greenfield mode.
You can set defaults anytime by running mob setup again.
```

### Step 6: First Project Nudge

Encourage immediate action:

```

Your first Mobius project is waiting!

The best way to learn is by doing. Try:

  mob interview "Build a CLI tool for [something you need]"

Or explore examples:
  mob tutorial

You're going to love seeing vague ideas turn into
crystal-clear specifications. Let's build something amazing!
```

---

## Progressive Disclosure Schedule

Reveal features gradually to avoid overwhelm:

### Immediate (Plugin Mode)
- `mob interview` - Socratic clarification
- `mob seed` - Specification generation
- `mob unstuck` - Lateral thinking

### After Setup (MCP Mode)
- `mob run` - TUI execution
- `mob evaluate` - 3-stage verification
- `mob status` - Drift tracking

### Power User (Discover organically)
- Evolutionary loop and ralph persistence
- Cost prediction and optimization
- Session replay and debugging
- Custom agents and skills

---

## Uninstall

When invoked with `--uninstall`:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Mobius Uninstall
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This will remove:
- MCP server registration from ~/.claude/mcp.json
- Mobius block from CLAUDE.md

This will NOT remove:
- Plugin files in .claude-plugin/
- Any generated seeds or projects
- Your project data

Uninstall Mobius configuration? [Yes / No]
```

If Yes:
1. Remove `mobius` entry from `~/.claude/mcp.json` (if exists)
2. Remove `<!-- mob:START -->` to `<!-- mob:END -->` block from CLAUDE.md (if exists)
3. Confirm: "Mobius plugin configuration removed. To remove plugin files, run: claude plugin uninstall mobius"

---

## Setup Troubleshooting

### "python3: command not found"
```
Plugin mode still works! You can use:
- mob interview
- mob seed
- mob unstuck

For Full Mode, install Python >= 3.12:
  macOS: brew install python@3.12
  Ubuntu: sudo apt install python3.12
  Windows: python.org/downloads
```

### "uvx: command not found"
```
uvx is recommended but not required. Alternative:

Install Mobius globally (see docs/getting-started.md for all options):
  pip install mobius-ai

Then update ~/.claude/mcp.json with:
  "command": "python"
  "args": ["-m", "mobius", "mcp", "serve"]
```

### "~/.claude/mcp.json conflicts"
```
Mobius will merge with existing MCP servers.
If you see issues, share your ~/.claude/mcp.json content and
we'll help you resolve conflicts.
```

## Conversion Metrics Track

Track these checkpoints for conversion optimization:

- [ ] Started setup (skill invoked)
- [ ] Environment detected successfully
- [ ] MCP server registration accepted
- [ ] CLAUDE.md integration accepted
- [ ] Verification passed
- [ ] Brownfield repos scanned and registered
- [ ] Default brownfield repo selected
- [ ] First project started (mob interview)
- [ ] First seed generated (mob seed)
- [ ] First execution completed (mob run)

A fully converted user = all checkpoints passed
