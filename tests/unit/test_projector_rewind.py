"""Unit tests for LineageProjector rewind handling.

Covers:
- find_resume_point skipping legacy "rewound" phase events
- find_resume_point returning correct state after rewind
- project() truncating generations on lineage.rewound event
- rewind_history populated with discarded generations
- failure_error preserved in projected GenerationRecord
- multiple rewinds produce multiple RewindRecords
